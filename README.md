# SingleWebPageApp

<h3><b>Data Representation and Querying Project</b></h3>
In this repository is the code to my Single Web Page Application which I created as a project for one of my College modules, Data Representation and Querying.

<h3><b> Overview of Project </b></h3>
I first spent the first while debating on what to do my project on. I had initially came up with the ideas of:
   
    1. Shopping List Entry App
    2. Address Book App
    3. Anonymous Story Blog

After alot of brainstorming on these ideas, I opted for <b> 3.Anonymous Story Blog.</b> I went with the anonymous Story Blog idea as I felt it was something different and not as common as ideas 1 and 2. I also feel that this anonymous stroy blog could help alot of of people out there who feel trapped and lonely and  need to get something off their chest without being identified they they so wish.
