He lived to the ripe old age of 87." "That is nothing," says Sean, "here is one named Patrick O Toole, it says here that he was 95 when he died." Just then, Seamus yells out, "Good God, heres a fella that got to be 145!" "What was his name?" asks Paddy. Seamus stumbles around a bit, awkwardly lights a match to see what else is written on the stone marker and exclaims: "Miles, from Dublin." - Timmy K, Kerry', 'Date': currDate}
